<h1>Pros and cons of IoT<h1>
<h2>Some of the advantages of IoT include the following:<h2>
<li><a<h4>ability to access information from anywhere at any time on any device.<h4></a></li>
<li><a<h4>improved communication between connected electronic devices.<h4></a></li>
<li><a<h4>transferring data packets over a connected network saving time and money.<h4></a></li>
<li><a<h4>automating tasks helping to improve the quality of a business's services and reducing the need for human intervention.<h4></a></li>
<h2>Some disadvantages of IoT include the following:<h2>
<li><a<h4>As the number of connected devices increases and more information is shared between devices, the potential that a hacker could steal confidential information also increases.<h4></a></li>
<li><a<h4>Enterprises may eventually have to deal with massive numbers -- maybe even millions -- of IoT devices, and collecting and managing the data from all those devices will be challenging.<h4></a></li>
<li><a<h4>If there's a bug in the system, it's likely that every connected device will become corrupted.<h4></a></li>
<li><a<h4>Since there's no international standard of compatibility for IoT, it's difficult for devices from different manufacturers to communicate with each other.<h4></a></li>
